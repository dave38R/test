# Making an artificial neuron

## Explanation : 
in this branch, I will try to make an artificial neuron from scratch.  
I will be using Sublime Text 3 to code, and some Python editor to check that what I did is ok. 


## Sources :
I have used the google collab notebook Corrig√©_Perceptron.ipynb available on the Christopher.ai google drive.
